structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## 📖How to complete the Challenge

Clone your starter code (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram).

Refactor the code to meet the Acceptance Criteria.

Make sure your work meets the full list of grading requirements.

Follow the instructions to submit your Challenge for review.

## 📝 Notes

This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
