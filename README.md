# 📖 Actual Behavior

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## 📖Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical 
structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## 📖How to complete the Challenge

Clone your starter code (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram).

Refactor the code to meet the Acceptance Criteria.

Make sure your work meets the full list of grading requirements.

Follow the instructions to submit your Challenge for review.

## 📝 Notes

This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
